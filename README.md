🌐 Personal Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and background. The website is built with a clean and modular structure, focusing on maintainability and simplicity.
🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5 – Structure and content
CSS3 – Styling and responsive design
PHP – Server-side scripting and dynamic content handling
📁 Project Architecture
To keep the code organized and reusable, the website uses external PHP files to manage data.
All dynamic data (such as projects, skills, or experience) is stored in external PHP files
These files contain arrays that hold structured data
The main PHP pages import and loop through these arrays to display content dynamically
✔ Benefits of this approach:
Easy content updates without editing layout files
Cleaner and more readable code
Better scalability for future enhancements
🚀 Features
Fully responsive design
Modular PHP structure
Dynamic content loading using arrays
Simple and clean UI
